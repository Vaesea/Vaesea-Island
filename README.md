# Vaesea Island
This is a SuperTux 0.3.2 add-on that adds a whole new world with more than 10 levels! Not a lot of levels but it's still a decent amount.

The levels are made to copy the feel of old SuperTux levels. They're not meant to be too difficult and they're meant to be very simple (that's why there's barely any "going up" in most levels)
